# ElektrotechnikEinfuehrung
introductionary presentation to electronics on a very basic level

The slides are meant to be used as the basis for a presentation. Although I tried keeping it on a scientific level, it is meant for total beginners so sometimes things are described a bit easier or with more fluffy words than accurate :-)
